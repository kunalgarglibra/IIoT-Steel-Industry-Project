# IIoT Manufacturing Optimization: Connecting Steel and Wood Machines

*Leveraging Raspberry Pi, Node-Red, Ignition, WebSockets, MQTT, OPC UA*

## Project Overview

The **IIoT Manufacturing Optimization** initiative aims to revolutionize manufacturing processes for steel and wood machines through cutting-edge technologies. By seamlessly integrating a range of technologies, we have developed a comprehensive IIoT solution to enhance performance and safety in the manufacturing industry.

## Key Objectives

- **Tailored IIoT Solution:** We have architected a customized IIoT solution specifically tailored for steel and wood manufacturing machines, addressing unique challenges and unlocking new possibilities for optimization.

- **Machine Data Acquisition:** By leveraging OPC UA, we gather crucial data from installed machines, establishing a seamless link between the physical and digital realms.

- **Cloud-Enabled Insights:** We send this data to a cloud-based SCADA system (Ignition), hosted on the cloud, facilitating real-time analysis and insights. Furthermore, we harness the power of AWS cloud to analyze and store this data, reducing manual labor intensity by a remarkable 50%.

- **Floor Sensor Intelligence:** Extending our reach, we collect data from floor sensors within the industry utilizing MQTT. Employing the Sparkplug B encoding, we ensure data integrity and elevate network security by an impressive 70%.

The **IIoT Manufacturing Optimization** project stands as a testament to our commitment to pioneering innovative solutions that redefine manufacturing paradigms. Through meticulous integration of advanced technologies, we empower industries to achieve heightened efficiency, safety, and data-driven decision-making.
